# Multi-Modal-Document-Intelligence
This project implements a Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions from complex, real-world documents such as financial and policy reports. Unlike traditional text-only QA systems, this solution processes text, tables, and scanned images (OCR) to deliver accurate, context-grounded answers with source attribution.


## Project Objective 
Modern documents contain diverse information formats that standard LLM pipelines often overlook. This project aims to build an intelligent document QA system capable of understanding and reasoning over multiple data modalities.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 Multi-Modal Ingestion
- Extracts **text**, **tables**, and **images** (via OCR)
- Supports both **scanned** and **structured** PDF documents

### 🔹 Smart Chunking & Embeddings
- Semantic and structural document segmentation
- Unified embedding space across multiple modalities

### 🔹 Vector-Based Retrieval
- Efficient similarity search over multi-modal content
- Context-aware document retrieval for accurate grounding

### 🔹 RAG-Powered QA Chatbot
- Interactive question-answering interface
- Responses generated using retrieved document context

### 🔹 Source Attribution
- Page-level or section-level citations for transparency and traceability

### 🔹 Evaluation Ready
- Supports benchmarking across **text**, **table**, and **image** queries

## 🧠 Outcome
This project reflects real-world challenges in multi-modal document intelligence, emphasizing system design, reasoning, and engineering rigor over simple model usage. The solution demonstrates how complex requirements can be translated into an efficient and extensible RAG-based architecture.
